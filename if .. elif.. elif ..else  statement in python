x = int(input("Please enter an integer: "))
Please enter an integer: 42
if x < 0:
    x = 0
    print('Negative changed to zero')
elif x == 0:
    print('Zero')
elif x == 1:
    print('Single')
else:
    print('More')
There can be zero or more number of elif  and elif is shorterform of else if, In the above program if the integer x is lessthan zero or equal to zero 
it prints 'Negative changed to zero' or it checks the next elif statement x==0 it it is true prints zero or goes to next elif finally checks the else .
if and elif condition return false then returns else statement by default.
