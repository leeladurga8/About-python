What is time complexity?
The time taken to each statement of code in an algorithm to be executed.there are three types of time complexity  bestcasecomplexity,
averagecasecomplexity,worstcasecomplexity.
why do we ignore constants?
As the input increases  the constant make negligible importance so we cannot consider constants.
