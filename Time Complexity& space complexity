What is time complexity?
The time taken to each statement of code in an algorithm to be executed.there are three types of time complexity 
bestcasecomplexity,averagecasecomplexity,worstcasecomplexity.
why do we ignore constants?
As the input increases  the constant make negligible importance so we cannot consider constants.


what is space complexity?
The problem-solving using computer requires memory to hold temporary data or final result
while the programm is in execution.the amount of memory required by the algorithm to solve given 
problem is called space complexity of the algorithm.the amount of space taken by an algorithm to 
run as a function of the length of the input.
ex:nums = [1,2,3,1,5]
empty = []
for n in nums:
if n not in empty:
empty.append(n)
else:
print(n)
space complexity is -O(n)
